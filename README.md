## 📌 Challenge
The objective is to create a web application capable of identifying ideal candidates for specific positions, employing Artificial Intelligence to assess the profile based on the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA) criteria necessary for the role.

## 🏁 Project

**RecrutaTech** is an innovative web platform that offers essential features to streamline candidate recruitment. At the end of development, the platform should have the following
features:

* **Secure Login:** With a secure login system and multi-factor authentication, we ensure the protection of your company's data.

* **Simplified Job Descriptions:** Easily input and update desired job descriptions.

* **Smart Web Scraping:** The platform performs web scraping on various popular job sources, saving time in gathering candidate information.

* **KSA-Based Evaluation:** Using the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA) criteria, candidates are objectively ranked.

* **Candidate Ranking:** Identify candidates most suited to the job profile, saving resources on screening.

* **Email Notifications:** Receive email alerts as soon as selection process results are available.

## 📃 Product Backlog

![ Product Backlog V 2.0](https://github.com/CodeSquirrel-API/RecrutaTech/blob/main/docs/images/backlog-jpg.jpeg)
  
Some requirements, such as "Notifications for initiated searches" and "Sending emails to companies upon completing the search process," have been removed by the client. As for the
requirements of "Ensuring efficient web scraping and responsive response times," "Data protection for searches and information," and "In the event of interruptions, the system should
return web scraping operations," they have been temporarily suspended by the team's decision due to data privacy concerns. This occurred because we realized that the way we were
collecting information was not in line with data protection rules. We will keep the system inactive until we find a way to do this that respects all privacy rules and regulations in
effect.
