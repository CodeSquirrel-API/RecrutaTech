In the final stage of the project, we focused our efforts on improving artificial intelligence and integrating it with the application. Our AI can now classify candidates more accurately, highlighting the most qualified individuals for each specific profession. Additionally, users have the convenience of reviewing candidate information, including their contact details such as email or LinkedIn profile.
