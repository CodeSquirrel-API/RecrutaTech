 Some requirements such as "Notifications for initialized searches" and "Sending emails to companies upon the completion of the search process" have been removed by the client. Meanwhile, the requirements for "Ensuring efficient web scraping and responsive response times," "Data protection for searches and information," and "In the event of interruptions, the system should return web scraping operations" have been temporarily suspended by the team's decision due to data privacy concerns. This happened because we realized that the way we were collecting information was not in compliance with data protection rules. We will keep the system inactive until we find a way to do this while respecting all privacy rules and regulations in place.
As a result of these changes, adjustments have been made to the sprint 2 backlog, where we removed all tasks related to web scraping and redirected our efforts towards delivering the user authentication functionality.

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

When analyzing the MVP of the deliveries, it is evident that Sprint 2 does not hold the same degree of significance when compared to Sprint 3. Due to the challenges encountered, including issues related to web scraping and the occurrence of student events, the sprint ended up being shorter than planned, necessitating a delivery with a reduced level of value at this stage.

The current sprint faced significant challenges, with a delayed start due to holidays, events, and school exams, which postponed the commencement of planned activities. Furthermore, a change in the start of the backlog further impacted the schedule. Strategies are being implemented to optimize progress, including reevaluation of estimates, time management, and task prioritization. It was decided to postpone tasks related to authentication and research on machine learning to the next sprint.
