One of the critical project requirements was the ability to generate the KSA (Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities). We decided to prioritize the delivery of this feature during the first sprint. With this functionality, the user has the ability to create the KSA for any profession and job level, enabling the manual application of these criteria to candidates.

A detailed analysis of the burndown chart reveals that the start of the sprint experienced delays due to a combination of factors, including the need to conduct extensive research on platforms that enable data scraping (web scraping), delays in obtaining client responses, and significant challenges in implementing the ChatGPT API.
