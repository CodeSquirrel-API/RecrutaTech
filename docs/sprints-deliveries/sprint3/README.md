 Some requirements such as "Notifications for initialized searches" and "Sending emails to companies upon the completion of the search process" have been removed by the client. Meanwhile, the requirements for "Ensuring efficient web scraping and responsive response times," "Data protection for searches and information," and "In the event of interruptions, the system should return web scraping operations" have been temporarily suspended by the team's decision due to data privacy concerns. This happened because we realized that the way we were collecting information was not in compliance with data protection rules. We will keep the system inactive until we find a way to do this while respecting all privacy rules and regulations in place.
As a result of these changes, adjustments have been made to the sprint 2 backlog, where we removed all tasks related to web scraping and redirected our efforts towards delivering the user authentication functionality.
