## 📌 MVP - Minimum Viable Product 

In this sprint, we delivered a new feature that allows users to search for candidates in our database based on their profession and level of expertise. Users can now also manually assess the skills (Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes - KSA) of each candidate by reviewing their resumes.
Furthermore, in this sprint, we initiated the development of our machine learning solution.

During the execution of sprint 3, it was observed that some tasks would be completed earlier than expected, as the team demonstrated better performance than in previous deliveries. Therefore, we decided to intentionally add some bugs and tasks that would only be started in Sprint 4. Even with this adaptation, we were able to maintain a steady pace of work and, as a result, we achieved our goals. This demonstrates the team's efficiency in adapting to circumstances and maintaining the project's progress in a smooth manner.
