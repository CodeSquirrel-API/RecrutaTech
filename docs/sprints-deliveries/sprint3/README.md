In this sprint, we delivered a new feature that allows users to search for candidates in our database based on their profession and level of expertise. Users can now also manually assess the skills (Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes - KSA) of each candidate by reviewing their resumes.
Furthermore, in this sprint, we initiated the development of our machine learning solution.
